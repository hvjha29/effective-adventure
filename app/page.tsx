      <h1>Alisha's Travel Adventures</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome! I’m building a home for all my travel stories, itineraries, tips,
        photos, and the little moments that made each trip special.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is just beginning. Soon there will be:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Curated travel itineraries</li>
        <li>Photo journals from my trips</li>
        <li>Interactive maps of my adventures</li>
        <li>Travel tips and hacks I’ve learned over time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Stick around — this site will grow as I do.
